  <p class="uitleg">Here we will give you an detailed list of the materials we used, and why we chose specifically those for our bionic arm.<p>
    <h1 class="header">Motherboard</h1>
    <p class="uitleg">First of all we need a motherboard. We chose for the Arduino Nano, instead of a raspberry pi. <br>The reason for this choice was simple, Arduino is
      made for small robotic projects, so it would be easy for us to write some code the would work. <br>Because of the limited space we could
      use for the hardware, on of our primary targets was to use a small compact motherboard.<br> The Arduino Nano was small, compact and sufficient for the
      job at hand. </p>

      <br>
    <p class="uitleg">The use of an Arduino Nano is (compared to other motherboards) fairly easy. Because it is so small, the number of different options<br> is significantly
      smaller. Therefore even unexperienced users can understand how to use such a motherboard and how you have to connect all of the jumper wires.</p>
