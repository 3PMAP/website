      <p class="uitleg">Here we will give you an detailed list of the materials we used, and why we chose specifically those for our bionic arm.<p>
        <p class="header">Motherboard</p>
        <p class="uitleg">First of all we need a motherboard. We chose for the Arduino Nano, instead of a raspberry pi. <br>The reason for this choice was simple, Arduino is
          made for small robotic projects, so it would be easy for us to write some code the would work. <br>Because of the limited space we could
          use for the hardware, on of our primary targets was to use a small compact motherboard.<br> The Arduino Nano was small, compact and sufficient for the
          job at hand. </p>

          <br>
        <p class="uitleg">The use of an Arduino Nano is (compared to other motherboards) fairly easy. Because it is so small, the number of different options<br> is significantly
          smaller. Therefore even unexperienced users can understand how to use such a motherboard and how you have to connect all of the jumper wires.</p>

      <p id="about_us">We are Nathan, Yochem and Jelle. We are 18 years old and from the Netherlands. We started this project as a school project,
        we got so motivated by this project that we wanted to continue it outside school.
